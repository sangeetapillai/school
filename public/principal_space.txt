It is with great pleasure that I welcome you to the 2017-2018 school year. I am very excited to serve all of you in my fifth year as your principal. Last school year was a most successful one at every level; academically, athletically and as a school community. As great as the last school year was for Sonora, the 2017-18 school year has the potential to be even better. To do this, your continued help, leadership and support will be needed at our great high school!
